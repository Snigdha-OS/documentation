# Writing Documentation

Adding documentation can help countless future of Snigdha OS users. A few ideas of what to work on:

- User guides to help Snigdha OS end users with some advanced features.
- More [frequently asked questions](/introduction/faqs).
- Expanded [troubleshooting](/category/troubleshoot) steps.
- Step-by-step tutorials for Snigdha OS [development](/category/developers-guide) or [installation](/category/installation). 
- Improving literally anything else you think we should elaborate on or explain better.

A good way to find topics to write about is to look for common questions in the [support tag](https://forum.snigdhaos.org/t/support) of our community.
