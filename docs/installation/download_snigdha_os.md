### üíª **Step 2: Download the ISO File**

1. **Click on the Desired Edition**:  
   Once on the Snigdha OS download page, select the edition you want to install. The page will provide a direct download link or a mirror list for the ISO.

2. **Start the Download**:  
   After selecting your edition, click on the **Download** button. The file will typically be named something like:
   - `snigdhaos-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso`
   - Example: `snigdhaos-2024.12.01-x86_64.iso`

   Wait for the download to complete. The size is typically around 2-3 GB, depending on the edition.

### üîç **Step 3: Verify the Download (Optional)**

1. **Verify the Integrity of the ISO**:  
   To ensure that the ISO file has not been corrupted during download, it‚Äôs a good idea to verify its checksum (SHA256 or SHA1) to compare it with the official value.

   - **Check the provided checksum** on the Snigdha OS website.
   - **Run the following command** in the terminal (replace the filename with your downloaded ISO file):

     ```bash
     sha256sum snigdhaos-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso
     ```

   - Compare the output checksum with the one on the Snigdha OS website. If they match, your download is intact.

### üíø **Step 4: Create Bootable Media (USB or DVD)**

1. **Create a Bootable USB Drive on Linux**:

   - **Insert your USB Drive** and check its device name using the `lsblk` command:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```

   - **Write the ISO to the USB** using the `dd` command:
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=snigdhaos-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
     ```
     - Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB drive's actual device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).

2. **Create a Bootable USB Drive on Windows**:

   - Download and install **Rufus** from [Rufus website](https://rufus.ie/).
   - Insert your USB drive and launch Rufus.
   - Select the Snigdha OS ISO and choose the USB drive.
   - Click **Start** to create the bootable USB drive.

3. **Burn to a DVD (Optional)**:

   - If you prefer a DVD, use a tool like **ImgBurn** or **Brasero** to burn the ISO to a DVD.

### üöÄ **Step 5: Boot from USB or DVD**

3. **Set USB/DVD as Primary Boot Device**:
   - In BIOS/UEFI settings, set the USB drive or DVD as the primary boot device.

4. **Save and Reboot**:
