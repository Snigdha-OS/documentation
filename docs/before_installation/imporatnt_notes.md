# Important Notes

ðŸ“Œ We do not recommended you to install Snigdha OS via VM ('Virtual Machine' = virtual machine), as it is optimized for use on real hardware or physical machine.

ðŸ“Œ If there is an abnormal system shutdown occurs during installation, it is mainly due to the lack of available RAM (`nohang` kills the process to prevent the system from responding anymore).

ðŸ“Œ The use of inactive RAM (idle) is probably greater than other distributions since Snigdha OS uses ZRAM and other modifications to improve the general performance of the system.

ðŸ“Œ `Ventoy` doesn't seem to work properly because some users have reported problems. Use the utility you prefer such as, for example, dd to burn ISO to a USB stick.
