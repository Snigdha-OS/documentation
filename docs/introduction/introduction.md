# Introduction

Snigdha OS is a **light-weight, Powerful & Optimized** Operating System built for **Normal Users &  Penetration Testers.**

## ðŸ‘‰ Features 

As a penetration distribution, [Snigdha OS](https://snigdhaos.org/) serves several features & purposes. Some of them we've mentioned below:

**ðŸ“Œ Tailored Toolset**: Penetration testing often requires a specific set of tools for tasks such as network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation. As a penetration distribution, Snigdha OS comes with collection of pre-installed tools that cater to these needs, ensuring that testers have everything they require readily available.

**ðŸ“Œ Customization and Optimization**: Different penetration testers have different preferences and requirements. Snigdha OS  allows you tuning the operating system to maximize performance, minimize resource usage, and streamline workflows, leading to more efficient testing processes.

**ðŸ“Œ Security Focus**: Snigdha OS is hardened and configured with security in mind from the ground up. This includes enabling security features like SELinux or AppArmor, implementing strict firewall rules, and disabling unnecessary services to reduce the attack surface.

**ðŸ“Œ Documentation and Support**: Snigdha OS provieds comprehensive documentation and support resources which can be immensely beneficial for both novice and experienced testers. Clear instructions on [tool](/category/tools) usage, [troubleshooting guides](/category/troubleshoot), and [community forums](https://forum.snigdhaos.org/) can help users navigate challenges and enhance their skills.

**ðŸ“Œ Learning**: For educational purposes, Snigdha OS allows users to gain hands-on experience with various tools and techniques in a controlled environment. They can be used in educational settings, workshops, and certification programs to teach aspiring security professionals the fundamentals of penetration testing.

**ðŸ“Œ Consistency and Reproducibility**: As Snigdha OS standardized penetration distribution, it ensures consistency across testing environments, making it easier to replicate and verify results. This is particularly important for organizations conducting regular security assessments or compliance audits where reproducibility is essential.

**ðŸ“Œ Portability and Accessibility**: Snigdha OS can be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms, including [physical machines](/category/installation), [virtual machines](/installation/virtualbox_installation), and cloud instances. This flexibility enables testers to conduct assessments in diverse environments and adapt to different scenarios as needed.

**ðŸ“Œ Legal and Ethical Compliance**: Snigdha OS comes with licenses and usage agreements that clarify the permissible scope of testing activities. By providing a distribution with appropriate legal and ethical guidelines, developers can help ensure that testers adhere to industry standards and regulations.

**ðŸ“Œ Innovation and Experimentation**: We often do some experiments with our new tools, techniques, and methodologies in the field of cybersecurity. Being a part of Snigdha OS, you can help other developers to push the boundaries of existing practices and contribute to advancements in the field.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
