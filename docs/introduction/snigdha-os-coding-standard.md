# Coding Standard

### ✨ **Coding Standards for Snigdha OS Development**

To ensure that Snigdha OS maintains a high-quality codebase, it’s essential to follow these coding standards. These guidelines promote readability, maintainability, and collaboration while ensuring the code remains efficient and secure. 🚀  



### 1️⃣ **Consistent Naming Conventions**  
✅ Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.  
✅ Stick to a consistent naming convention across the codebase:  
   - **camelCase** for variables and functions.  
   - **PascalCase** for classes and constructors.  
   - **snake_case** for constants and configuration keys.  



### 2️⃣ **Indentation and Formatting**  
✅ Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces preferred). Avoid using tabs.  
✅ Follow a consistent formatting style (e.g., braces alignment, spacing).  
✅ Limit line length to 80-100 characters for better readability.  
✅ Remove unnecessary whitespaces and trailing spaces.  



### 3️⃣ **Comments**  
✅ Add comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, or unusual decisions.  
✅ Keep comments concise, relevant, and synchronized with code changes.  
✅ Avoid obvious comments like `// Incrementing i by 1`.  

```javascript
// Good Example:
function calculateTax(income) {
  // Calculates tax based on progressive slabs.
  ...
}
```



### 4️⃣ **Modularity and Code Reusability**  
✅ Break down code into small, reusable functions or modules.  
✅ Group related functionalities into classes or namespaces for better organization.  



### 5️⃣ **Error Handling**  
✅ Use proper error-handling mechanisms like `try-catch` blocks or error codes.  
✅ Avoid exposing internal logic in error messages.  

```python
try:
    result = perform_operation()
except ValueError as e:
    print("Invalid input. Please try again.")  # Avoid exposing "ValueError: details"
```



### 6️⃣ **Code Readability**  
✅ Write simple and clear code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.  
✅ Use descriptive variable and function names instead of single-letter identifiers.  
✅ Favor clarity over cleverness.  



### 7️⃣ **Consistent Code Style**  
✅ Follow the style guide for the programming language used (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript).  
✅ Adopt consistent practices for spacing, indentation, and braces placement.  



### 8️⃣ **Documentation**  
✅ Document every function, class, and module with clear descriptions.  
✅ Include parameter details, return values, and potential exceptions in documentation.  

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    """
    Calculates the area of a circle.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """
    return 3.14 * radius ** 2
```



### 9️⃣ **Testing**  
✅ Write unit tests for all critical functionality.  
✅ Aim for at least 80% code coverage.  
✅ Automate tests where possible with frameworks like `pytest`, `Jest`, or `JUnit`.  



### 🔟 **Version Control**  
✅ Use Git for version control. Follow branching strategies like **Git Flow**.  
✅ Write clear, descriptive commit messages in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format:  

```
feat: add feature for user authentication  
fix: resolve bug in payment gateway integration  
docs: update README with installation steps  
```



### 1️⃣1️⃣ **Performance Considerations**  
✅ Write efficient algorithms with optimal time and space complexity.  
✅ Avoid unnecessary loops, nested loops, or redundant operations.  
✅ Use lazy loading or caching for heavy computations or data fetching.  



### 1️⃣2️⃣ **Security**  
✅ Sanitize and validate all user inputs.  
✅ Use parameterized queries for database operations to avoid SQL injection.  
✅ Regularly audit code for vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, or buffer overflows.  



### 1️⃣3️⃣ **Dependencies and Third-party Libraries**  
✅ Use only necessary and trusted libraries.  
✅ Keep dependencies updated to ensure compatibility and fix vulnerabilities.  



### 1️⃣4️⃣ **Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)**  
✅ Design code to support multiple languages and locales.  
✅ Externalize strings into resource files for easy translation.  



### 1️⃣5️⃣ **Accessibility**  
✅ Ensure UI components follow accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).  
✅ Provide alternative text for images and ensure keyboard navigation.  



### 1️⃣6️⃣ **Concurrency and Thread Safety**  
✅ For concurrent operations, write thread-safe code to avoid race conditions.  
✅ Use synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores.  



### 🔑 **Key Principles**  
1️⃣ **Readability**: Write code as if the next person maintaining it is you in six months.  
2️⃣ **Modularity**: Make changes easier by keeping code decoupled and modular.  
3️⃣ **Consistency**: Adopt a uniform style to avoid confusion and ensure maintainability.  

Following these standards will not only improve code quality but also foster a collaborative and professional environment. Happy coding! 🎉👩‍💻👨‍💻
